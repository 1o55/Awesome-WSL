## FAQ

### 1. What is Linux?

Linux is a [UNIX-like](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-UNIX#frequently-asked-questions) [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) operating system. The core of Linux is a [kernel](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31632/what-is-the-linux-kernel-and-what-does-it-do/) developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Linux also includes a wide array of applications built on top of the kernel, including [web servers](https://www.linux.com/learn/apache-ubuntu-linux-beginners), [compilers](https://gcc.gnu.org/), and [e-mail clients](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary), developed and contributed to the Linux ecosystem by a worldwide community of programmers. These applications are then assembled together into Linux [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) by communities, companies, and individuals.

### 2. What is a Linux distribution?

Unlike Windows or macOS there are many different Linux distributions, each of which is assembled with different approaches to the software selection and implementation. For example, the goal of the non-profit volunteer [Debian Project](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution) community is to produce a universal free operating system. The goal of the CentOS project is to provide a [stable enterprise platform](https://www.centos.org/about/) compatible with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution. There are also Linux distributions based on other distributions. Ubuntu is a distribution based on Debian built by the company Canonical for [paid use in the enterprise market](https://www.ubuntu.com/support). Kali is a distribution based on Debian built with an emphasis on tools for network security testing. You can see the most popular distributions at [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/).

### 3. What is Windows?

Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems, all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Currently Windows 10 is Microsoft's flagship operating system. Windows 10 is available for Intel x86-based and arm64-based PCs. The Windows Subsystem for Linux first shipped in [Windows 10 Anniversary Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/07/08/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-10-anniversary-update/), version number 1607, in August 2016. WSL can be enabled for free on all versions of Windows 10 after 1607, including Home, Professional, Enterprise, Server, LTSB, and Education. Originally only available for Intel x86-based PCs, Ubuntu 18.04 for arm64 was made available on the Microsoft store in [May 2018](https://twitter.com/TheRealHariP/status/994293523514970112).

### 4. What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux?

Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. No re-compilation is required. WSL provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft and allows a user to chose a Linux distribution to install from the Microsoft Store. Linux applications run within the Linux distribution which provides the application's dependencies and package management in a container-like environment.

### 5. Is Windows Subsystem for Linux an emulator?

No. Windows Subsystem for Linux is not an emulator or virtualizer like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). WSL executes unmodified Linux ELF64 binaries by emulating a Linux kernel interface on top of the Windows kernel in Windows 10. The WSL kernel interface translates Linux system calls to Windows system calls which executes them at native speed. WSL is closer in it's approach to [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) which is a compatibility layer to run Windows binaries on Linux by re-implementing Windows system and API calls in libraries.

### 6. How does Windows Subsystem for Linux *really* work?

### 7. How do I install the Windows Subsystem for Linux?

* [Windows 10 Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) - Microsoft's official guide.
* [Windows 10 Server Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server) - Microsoft's official guide for Windows Server.
* [Windows-Subsystem-For-Linux-Setup](https://github.com/michaeltreat/Windows-Subsystem-For-Linux-Setup) - A basic guide for how to get setup with the WSL feature that is included with Windows 10. ![github project][githublogo]

### 8. What can I do with Windows Subsystem for Linux?

WSL is undoubtedly a tool for power users, developers, and *NIX/Linux geeks who want to run Windows. Most of the things you can do with WSL are going to be related to programming, sysadmin, automation, AI/data science, and other geeky things.

### 9. Can I install Linux GUI apps?

Yes, [some](https://github.com/ethanhs/WSL-Programs) of them. This first requires installation of X server application such as [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (recommended) or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) on Windows 10.

Then in WSL type the following:

```bash
echo "export DISPLAY=:0" >> .bashrc
echo "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1" >> .bashrc
```

and restart WSL. The above commands point WSL to the X server you installed on Windows and offloads hardware graphics acceleration to Windows 10 for faster graphical rendering.

## Using WSL
