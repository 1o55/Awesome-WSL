## FAQ

### What is Linux?

Linux is a [UNIX-like](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-UNIX#frequently-asked-questions) [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) operating system. The core of Linux is a kernel (the piece of the operating system that lies between the hardware and the applications you choose to run) developed by Linus Torvalds. Linux also includes a wide array of applications, including web servers, compilers, and e-mail clients, developed and contributed by tens of thousands of programmers. These applications are then bundled together into distributions by communities, companies, and individuals.

### What is a Linux distribution?

Unlike Windows there are many different Linux distributions, each of which is assembled with different approaches to software selection and implementation. For example, the goal of the non-profit volunteer Debian Project community is to produce a universal operating system. There are also Linux distributions based on other distributions. Ubuntu is a distribution based on Debian built by for-profit company Canonical for paid use in the enterprise market. Kali is a distribution based on Debian built with an emphasis on tools for network security testing.

### What is Windows?

Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems, all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Windows Subsystem for Linux first shipped in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, version number 1607, in August 2016. WSL can be enabled on all versions of Windows after 1607, including Home, Professional, Enterprise, Server, LTSB, and Education.

### What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux?

Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. WSL provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft, which can then run a Linux userland of the users choice on top of it. It is the successor to defunct [Windows Services for UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Services_for_UNIX).

### Is Windows Subsystem for Linux an emulator?

No. Windows Subsystem for Linux is not an emulator, or like Wine, or VirtualBox. WSL executes unmodified Linux ELF64 binaries by emulating a Linux kernel interface on top of the Windows NT kernel.

### What can I do with Windows Subsystem for Linux?

WSL is undoubtedly a tool for power users, developers, and *NIX/Linux geeks who want to run Windows. Most of the things you can do with WSL are going to be related to programming, sysadmin, automation, AI/data science, and other geeky things.

### Can I install Linux GUI apps?

Yes, some of them. This first requires installation of X server application such as [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (recommended) or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) on Windows 10.

Then in WSL type the following:

```bash
echo "export DISPLAY=:0" >> .bashrc
echo "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1" >> .bashrc
```

and restart WSL. The above commands point WSL to the X server you installed on Windows and offloads hardware graphics acceleration to Windows for faster graphical rendering.
